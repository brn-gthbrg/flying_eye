## Acknowledgments
We would like to give a huge thank you to [Aldo Vargas](https://github.com/alduxvm) for creating an well documented Python library within the drone community, and for taking the time to advise and support us throughout this project. 

We were inspired to create this project after a realization of this projects impact. The idea sources from [Brian Gothberg](https://github.com/brn-gthbrg) who realized how difficult it was to track his form while swimming. As a porfessional lifegard and developer he took the inititive to bring along three more members to built out his vision for a better way to improve his swimming skills.
