) who rea
We were inspired to create this project after a realization of this project's impact. The idea is sourced from [Brian Gothberg](https://github.com/brn-gthbrg) because of how difficult it was to track his form while swimming. As a professional lifegard and developer he took the inititive to bring along three more members to build out his vision for a better way to improve his swimming skills.
