We would like to give a huge thank you to Aldo Vargas for creating an well documented Python library within the drone community, and for taking the time to advise and support us throughout this project. 
) who rea
We were inspired to create this project after a realization of this project's impact. The idea is sourced from [Brian Gothberg](https://github.com/brn-gthbrg) because of how difficult it was to track his form while swimming. As a professional lifegard and developer he took the inititive to bring along three more members to build out his vision for a better way to improve his swimming skills.

## Summary
Clearly this is a work in process
